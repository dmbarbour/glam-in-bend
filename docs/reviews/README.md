# Reviews

A review checks work against intent: a design, a plan's steps, a subsystem.
It lists findings, each with a stable ID (`F1`, `F2`, …; write
`<Review> F3` where ambiguous) and a verdict.

- **Quote what you find.** A finding cites the text or code it is about,
  with its location. A claim relayed from another reviewer or agent is
  checked against the source before it is reported.
- **Small fixes go in the review.** A finding may be fixed in the commit
  that records it, or by follow-ups citing its ID. Work that needs steps of
  its own becomes a plan.
- **Files and retirement follow [plans](../plans/README.md):**
  `docs/reviews/<Topic>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, listed below while active, and
  retired by extracting decisions and removing references, then deleted
  with its last commit listed.

- `LawsInBend_2026-11-06.md`: where Blend writes laws and proofs, against
  how Bend checks them; its decisions in Blend's `blend-laws-in-module`,
  built as Blend's `blend-module-laws`; last commit 03cb4ac.
